# ✅ Headshot V1.0 - Simplified (Stateless)

## 🎯 What Changed

Headshot generation is now **stateless** like image-to-image mode.

---

## 📊 Before vs After:

| Feature | Before (Complex) | After (V1.0 Simple) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Database saves** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Generation history** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Status tracking** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Cleanup needed** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Response** | Generation ID + URLs | Just URL |
| **User experience** | Can view history | Lost if app closes |
| **Code complexity** | High | Low |

---

## 🔄 Current Flow (V1.0):

```
1. User uploads image to Firebase
   ↓
2. App sends URL to backend
   ↓
3. Backend validates & checks credits
   ↓
4. Backend calls GetImg.ai
   ↓
5. GetImg.ai returns generated headshot URL
   ↓
6. Backend deducts credits
   ↓
7. Backend returns URL to app
   ↓
8. ❌ Nothing saved to database
   ↓
9. User sees result immediately
   ↓
10. ❌ Result lost if app closes
```

## 📝 API Usage (V1.0):

### Request:
```json
POST /api/headshots/generate

{
  "imageUrl": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/.../photo.jpg",
  "style": "corporate",
  "aspectRatio": "1:1"
}
```

### Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Headshot generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://cdn.getimg.ai/generated/abc123.jpg",

## 📱 Mobile App Integration (V1.0):

### Flutter Example:
```dart
Future<String?> generateHeadshot({
  required String imageUrl,
  required String style,
  required String aspectRatio,
}) async {
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('$apiUrl/api/headshots/generate'),
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer $userToken',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: jsonEncode({
      'imageUrl': imageUrl,
      'style': style,
      'aspectRatio': aspectRatio,
    }),
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
    final headshotUrl = data['data']['url'];
    
    // ⚠️ Important: Save URL immediately!
    // User will lose it if app closes
    return headshotUrl;
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

### Important Notes:
```dart
// ⚠️ V1.0: User must save/download immediately
// Show "Save to Photos" dialog right after generation
// Don't expect to retrieve it later - no history!

void onHeadshotGenerated(String url) {
  // Show save dialog immediately
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (_) => AlertDialog(
      title: Text('Save Your Headshot'),
      content: Text('Download now or it will be lost!'),
      actions: [
        TextButton(
          onPressed: () => downloadImage(url),
          child: Text('Download'),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```
